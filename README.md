**Description**

This project is a Python-based assembler for a simplified hardware language, inspired by the "Nand to Tetris" course. It converts assembly-like instructions into machine code that can be executed by a basic CPU emulator.

**Technologies Used**

Python

Parsing Algorithms

Symbol Table Management

**Features**

Converts assembly instructions into binary machine code

Implements a symbol table for variable handling

Parses and processes instructions efficiently

**How to Run**
Clone the repository:git clone <repo_url>

Navigate to the project directory:cd nand

Run the assembler:python Main.py input.asm output.hack
